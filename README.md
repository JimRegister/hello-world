# hello-world
throw-away created as tutorial exercise
I'm a semi-retired software developer, formerly programming controllers for audio-visual and videoconferencing systems.
Language experience includes AMX NetLinx, C, RATFOR (Rational FORTRAN), and Microchip's MPASM
Used cvs and later svn. (Why? I was intersted in the LinuxCNC project, which used cvs at the time. To learn cvs, I started using it for my work projects, as the video group didn't have a version control system. Later, svn was implemented for the entire video team.)
Recently started playing around with Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems.
System designer for audio-visual and videoteleconferencing systems
Other experience includes electronic circuit design, circuit board layout, hardware/software integration.
Designed and built automated test set for the product.
Currently playing around with KiCad and want to help with the documentation, thus getting started with git and GitHub.
